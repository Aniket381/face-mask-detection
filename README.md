# 😷 Face Mask Detection – CNN Project

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify whether a person is wearing a face mask or not. The model was built and trained using Google Colab and the Face Mask Detection dataset from Kaggle.

## 📁 Files

- `Face_Mask_Detection.ipynb` – Colab notebook containing preprocessing, CNN training, and evaluation.
- Dataset used: [Face Mask Detection Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omkargurav/face-mask-dataset)

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- Image preprocessing (resizing, normalization)
- Deep learning with TensorFlow/Keras
- Binary classification: Mask vs. No Mask

## 🧪 Results

- Achieved **92% accuracy** on the test dataset
- Trained using **Google Colab** with GPU support

## ▶️ Run it in Colab

## 🚀 Future Work

- Integrate with OpenCV for real-time webcam detection
- Extend to multi-class classification (e.g. improper mask)
